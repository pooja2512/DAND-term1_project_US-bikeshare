# DAND_Term 1_Project_US_Bikeshare

US Bikeshare project was completed under certification of [Udacity Nanodegree Program](https://in.udacity.com/)

Data was collected from [Motivate](https://www.motivateco.com/), a bike share system provider for many major cities in the United States, to uncover bike share usage patterns. In this project I will compare the system usage between three large cities: Chicago, New York City, and Washington DC.

An interactive experience was created to allow users select specific city,month,day of the week.
