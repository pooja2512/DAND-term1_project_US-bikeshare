# DAND-term1-Project_US-bikeshare

## Overview

Data was collected from [Motivate](https://www.motivateco.com/), a bike share system provider for many major cities in the United States, to uncover bike share usage patterns. In this project I will compare the system usage between three large cities: Chicago, New York City, and Washington DC.

An interactive experience was created to allow users select specific city,month,day of the week. 

User was then provided with 

- Common start station
- Common End station
- Frequent combinations of Start and End stations
- Trip Dusrations
- User statistics
- Recent,Common,Most Earliest Birth Years
- Visualizations
